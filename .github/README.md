# Sergio's Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles.

As you may notice from the files, the following software is required:

- git (duh)
- zsh (with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/))
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

These files are tracked locally using a **bare git repository**, so I don't have to turn my whole home directory into a repo. I took inspiration from this [article by Greg Owen](https://stegosaurusdormant.com/bare-git-repo), so it's worth a read if you want more context.

## Setup

To set up these dotfiles on a new machine:

1. Clone the repository. The bare repo and the working tree should be [separate](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt-code--separate-git-dirltgit-dirgtcode)

```bash
cd
git clone --separate-git-dir=$HOME/dotfiles <github-url> dotfiles-tmp
```

2. Configure the bare repo to not show untracked files in its status

```bash
git --git-dir=$HOME/dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME config status.showUntrackedFiles no
```

3. Copy the contents of the temporary folder to your home directory:

```bash
rsync --recursive --verbose --exclude '.git' dotfiles-tmp/ $HOME/
```

4. Remove the temporary directory:

```bash
rm -rf dotfiles-tmp
```

## Adding and Committing Changes

The `.zshrc` file includes two simple functions (`dotfiles`, `undotfiles`) to set up the correct git directory and working tree. This allows us to work with the bare repo with our usual git commands (and aliases).

After setting up your dotfiles bare repo, you can commit changes to your dotfiles as follows:

1. Configure git to work with your dotfiles repo

```bash
dotfiles
```

**Note:** This assumes you are not using neither the `GIT_DIR` nor the `GIT_WORK_TREE` environment variables. Calling this function will override both of them.

2. Do all relevant `git`-ing related to your dotfiles, for example:

```bash
git add -u # Update all tracked files
git commit -m "a commit message"
git push
```

**Important:** Don't use `git add .`, this will add **all the files** in your home directory to the staging area!

3. Revert git's config to its usual defaults

```bash
undotfiles
```
